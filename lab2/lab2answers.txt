2-1:

We notice that the bunny is chopped in slices.
This makes us believe that cylindrical geometry was used to map.

A strange texture using modulo and other math functions.

2-2:
No?

Memory is the limited resource. You don't want to reupload the texture every time, therefor you make a reference to it in the .C file.
Also, you can't have strings defined in the shaders.

2-3:
We put the projectionMatrix to the left and the mdlMatrix right in the gl_position calculations.
This is because we want to rotate and translate the model before doing the projecting.
The mdlMatrix consists of R before T, because we wanted to rotate the model before we used the translate matrix (moving it).

2-4:
We can't place the camera at position v. We can't even look at position v.

2-5:
We used Gourand shading, since we do the light calculations in vert.

We don't need vec4 for light normals etc because we only care about direction, not the position, for these vectors.

2-6:
We couldn't see a massive differense, but in some parts of the bunny it was clear.
You can tell that Phong is more "direct" while Gourand is more "spread out".
