3-1:
Only rotate one blade and draw the other ones as rotated(by pi/2, pi and -pi/2) copies.

??????

This could be accomplished by manual editing the position with the arrow keys.

3-2:
Keyboard implement, to move the camera around the windmill.

We can technically have the camera stationary and just move the entire world instead.

3-3:
We used the same camera matrix for the skybox, but we zeroed out the translations.

We handled each object as a unique object with unique matrices. It's not good to do this if there are many objects in the scene.

We rotate the skybox together with the world, as the camera is stationary. What we don't do is to move the skybox in any direction while the world moves.

It doesn't have a floor! We got pissed off when we saw it in blender. :)))))
