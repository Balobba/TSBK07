4-1:
The heightmap contains 256 different types of height. (According to GIMP, the input range is from 0-255)

It contains one polygon.

4-2:
Yes we rebuilt the whole camera movement function.

4-3:
The fast one, 3 neighbors v1,v2,v3. The normal is cross product of v1-v2 and v1-v3.

4-4:
We check the x and z for the object to find the quad.
To find the triangle we check if x+z is above or below one.

We calculate the height by using the plane equation with the three corners of
the triangle as three points in the plane. We then use them to calculate a
normal which gives us an equation which we solve for our height(y-coordinate).

4-5:
A multi-texture) We check if the y coordinates are above a certain value, then we use another
texture. This is done in the fragment shader.

D water) we check for y coordinates below a threshold.
